/**
 * This class is a helper class for calculating statistics
 * based on a list of integer values. In both Question 1 and
 * Question 2, you will need to calculate the min, max,
 * mean, Q1, Q2, and Q3 of a list of integers, as well as
 * count the frequency of each integer.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This class is not yet complete, so must be
 * completed by you.
 *
 * To accomplish this, you should fill in the missing parts
 * of this code. Project 3 builds upon Projects 1 and 2
 * here! Finding the top N foods by calorie count is similar
 * to finding the first second and third quartiles. I
 * recommend you consider using a min heap (via the
 * PriorityQueue class) to complete this code. However, you
 * may use whatever means you prefer (sorting, your solution
 * to Project 1, etc.).
